# Genesis Shell

Next generation desktop &amp; mobile shell

## Why Flutter?

Flutter supports mobile and desktop devices. Since the goal is to provide
a convergence experience, it would make sense to use a framework designed
for both mobile and desktop devices. The adaptive and responsive nature
of Flutter along side with it's easy to use developer tools makes it
a great contender.
